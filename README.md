# Simple-Console-Database-App
A simple C# console database app using SQLite3. <br>
<br>
To be able to extend SQLite's functions to freely manipulate non-ASCII characters, I used System.Data.SQLite.Core.ICU NuGet package by Radik Komissaroff. By doing so, I utilized the ICU extension of SQLite. <br>
<br>
Full project is deployed here, meaning that it can be used after cloning.
